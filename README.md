## Background
Delivery service is a type of service that delivers orders (usually goods) to customers' locations. 
It is very convenient and popular nowadays, especially for food and beverage businesses. However, delivering
food on time is a major challenge for this service. Customers expect transparency and accuracy in the 
delivery time. Therefore, machine learning algorithms can be used to analyze historical data and predict the
delivery time more accurately.

## Objectives
- How does the distance and traffic between the restaurant and the destination affect the food delivery time?
- How good is the food delivery time estimation accuracy?

## Conclusions
-Delivery time of food to the destination location depends on the rating and age of the person who delivers it. People who have higher ratings and are 30 years old deliver food faster than people who have lower ratings and are older than 30 years. 
- The model's RMSE score is 36.20, which indicates that the average difference between the predicted and actual delivery times is 36.20 minutes.
